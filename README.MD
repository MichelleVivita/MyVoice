# MyVoice

Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can find it hard to relate to and communicate with other people. ASD kids are often intimidated by social aspects of classrooms. That is, until given technology. It is said said that if they can't learn the way we teach, then we teach the way they learn. Hence, we have come up with this application called MyVoice. By incorporating photograph-based avatars into conversation, the computer devices' screen could encourage could encourage people with autism to face socio-communicative cues. 

In essence, MyVoice serves as a link between the mind of the autistic child and the people around him/her. The world will advance, only when people with varied social environments can voice their thoughts. Thus, MyVoice aims at stimulating dialogue between neurotypical and autistic individuals capturing the magic of their uniqure minds.
